### General Statistics

#### Total points and win ratio

```{r echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

cat("Total Points in the season: ", sum(teamGames$Points))
cat("Number of games per result type:")

table(teamGames$Points)
```

#### Position on the table

```{r echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
SeasonTable <- data.frame(Team=unique(SeasonData$HomeTeam), 
                 Points= rep(0,length(unique(SeasonData$HomeTeam))))


totalPoints <- function(team)
{
  teamGames <- functionTeamGames(team)
  sum(teamGames$Points)
  
}

SeasonTable$Points <- unlist(lapply(SeasonTable$Team, totalPoints))
SeasonTable
```

**Rank**

```{r echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
order.scores<-order(SeasonTable$Points,SeasonTable$Team)
SeasonTable$rank <- NA
SeasonTable$rank[order.scores] <- 1:nrow(SeasonTable)

cat(params$team, "finished in",21-SeasonTable$rank[SeasonTable$Team==params$team] ,"th place in EPL season-",params$season)
```


#### Shot Conversion Rate
```{r echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(teamGames, aes(x=ShotsonTarget,y=TeamGoals,color=IsHomeAway)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Away", "Home"))+
  labs(x = "Number of shots",
       y = "Number of goals",
       title = "Shot Conversion Rate")
```



#### Win Percentage against the top - 6 in the season

```{r echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

top6 <- SeasonTable$Team[order(SeasonTable$rank)][16:20]
top6 <- top6[!top6 %in% params$team] # remove the team if it is also in the top-6

Gamestop6 <- teamGames %>% filter(Opponent %in% top6)

cat(params$team,"won", 100*sum(Gamestop6$Points==3)/nrow(Gamestop6)," % of their games against the top 6 in season ", params$season)
